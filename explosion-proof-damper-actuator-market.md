<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Explosion Proof Damper Actuator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators</li><li>Spring Return Damper Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The explosion-proof damper actuator market is categorized into two main types: non-spring return and spring return damper actuators. Non-spring return actuators maintain their position when power is lost, requiring an external force for repositioning, making them suitable for situations where constant control is necessary. In contrast, spring return actuators automatically return to a pre-defined position when power is removed, ensuring safety and operational reliability in emergency situations, especially in hazardous environments where explosion risks are present.</p></p>
