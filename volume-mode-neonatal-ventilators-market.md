<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Volume Mode Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The volume mode neonatal ventilators market consists of two main types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators deliver breaths through an endotracheal tube, allowing precise control of tidal volume and pressure, which is crucial for critically ill neonates. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, provide respiratory support through masks or nasal prongs, reducing the risk of airway trauma. Both types are essential for managing respiratory distress in newborns, improving overall neonatal care and outcomes.</p></p>
