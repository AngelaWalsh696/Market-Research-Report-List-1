<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Milk Protein Hydrolysates Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Whey Protein Hydrolysates</li><li>Casein Protein Hydrolysates</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The milk protein hydrolysates market can be categorized into two main types: whey protein hydrolysates and casein protein hydrolysates. Whey protein hydrolysates are obtained through the enzymatic breakdown of whey, resulting in a fast-digesting protein ideal for muscle recovery and sports nutrition. Casein protein hydrolysates, derived from casein, are slower to digest, providing a sustained release of amino acids, making them suitable for meal replacement and overnight protein supplementation. Both types offer enhanced bioavailability and are used in various food and dietary products.</p></p>
