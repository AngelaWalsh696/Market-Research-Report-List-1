<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disconnect Switch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fused</li><li>Non-Fused</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The disconnect switch market is categorized into two main types: fused and non-fused disconnect switches. Fused disconnect switches incorporate protective fuses, providing overcurrent protection and enhancing safety during maintenance. They are suited for applications where equipment protection is critical. Non-fused disconnect switches lack this feature, primarily serving to isolate equipment for safe servicing without additional protection. They are often used in applications where overcurrent protection is handled separately. Both types are essential for ensuring safe operations in electrical systems.</p></p>
