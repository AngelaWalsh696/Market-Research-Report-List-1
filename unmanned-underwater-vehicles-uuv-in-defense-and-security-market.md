<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) in Defense and Security Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Remotely Operated Vehicle (Rov)</li><li>Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (Auv)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) are critical in defense and security, primarily categorized into Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). ROVs are tethered, allowing operators to control them in real-time for tasks like surveillance, reconnaissance, and mine detection. In contrast, AUVs function independently, utilizing pre-programmed missions for environmental monitoring, data gathering, and underwater exploration. Both types enhance maritime situational awareness, improve operational safety, and enable strategic capabilities in military and security operations.</p></p>
